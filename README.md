## Overall package architecture

#### OSM adapter
* Provides python interface for making queries to overpass API
* Provides method to query using OSM unique id as well based on OSM tags
* More complex queries can also be made by directly passing overpass query

Methods
```
- OSMAdapter(server_ip=, server_port=): constructor
  - server_ip : overpass server ip
  - server_port : overpass server port

- test_overpass_connection() - to check if overpass connection was successful

- get_osm_element_by_id(ids, data_type, role, role_type) : to find OSM element by id/s
  - ids : array containing OSM ids
  - data_type : node/way/relation
  - role : to query specific member of relation (optional)
  - role_type : data type of relation member with specified role (optional)

- search_by_tag(data_type, key, value, scope_id=, scope_role=, scope_role_type=): search OSM element by tag 
  - data_type : node/way/relation
  - key : key to identify tag
  - value : value of tag
  - scope_id : reduces the search scope to specified relation members (optional)
  - scope_role : relation member role where search should be performed (optional)
  - scope_role_type : data type of relation member with specified role (optional)

- get(raw_overpass_query) : can be used to make raw overpass queries
```

#### OSM bridge
* Provides abstraction to world model (https://git.ropod.org/ropod/wm/openstreetmap-indoor-modelling) using OSM adapter

## Note
* All the attributes maynot be available immediately once any `wm_entity` is initialised as different attributes are stored under different models in OSM. Most of the attributes will be available after loading geometry (if exist). 
* Querying each model requires atleast 1 overpass query, which can be time consuming as well as unnecessary most of thr times hence all the models are not loaded during initialisation


#### Path planner
Methods
```
- set_building(building ref) - to set building 
- set_cooridnate_system('spherical'/'cartesian') - to set cooridnate system
- get_path_plan(start floor ref,destination floor ref, start area ref, destination area ref)
  Optional keyword arguments:
    - start_local_area: start local area ref
    - destination_local_area: destination local area ref
    - destination_task: task tobe performed at destination
    - robot_position: robot starting position
    (2 of these 4 optional arguments are mandatory - 1 each for start and destination)
- get_estimated_path_distance(start floor ref, destination floor ref, start area ref, destination area ref) - returns estimated path distance in m
```
